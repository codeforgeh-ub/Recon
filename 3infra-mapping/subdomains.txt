## Notes & Observations:

- Heavy reliance on **Akamai CDN** infrastructure for asset delivery and edge routing.
- Several subdomains (like `api-firebolt-dev`, `-stage`) suggest **non-production environments**, which may be interesting for **attack surface mapping**.
- `click.email.tesla.com` is a common pattern for marketing tracking and may be part of a **third-party platform** (Adobe Campaign or Salesforce).
- Domain naming conventions indicate a **structured internal API system**, possibly with versioning and staging separation.
- Further investigation can be done on:
  - SSL/TLS config
  - Open ports
  - Technologies via Wappalyzer/Nuclei
  - Screenshots (using Aquatone or Gowitness)
